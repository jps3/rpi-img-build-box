# rpi-img-build-box

## Overview

This repo is used to create a customized Pi OS Lite build using [pi-gen](https://github.com/RPi-distro/pi-gen), with some additions (ex. salt-minion) as both NOOBS and standard `*.img` file.

Vagrant will use a Debian box on either VMware Fusion/Workstation or Linuxâ€™s libvirt, and provision using Ansible to prepare the VM with the packages and tools necessary to more easily use the pi-gen tools.

**NOTE:** The default provisioning and pi-gen customization is aimed toward building a 3DPrinterOS client.


## Considerations

1. It _really_ helps to have prior experience with Vagrant and virtual machines in general.
1. It _really_ helps to have command line experience with your host operating system.
1. It _really_ helps to have command line experience with Linux.
1. It helps to have some basic experience with Docker containers.
